This toolbox helps readers to reproduce all results in the paper "Generalized local Kendall’s τ: a novel framework for uncovering nonlinear local dependence" (Huang & Zhang, 2026).

1. Operation Steps: Illustrated with Example 1
   Step 1: run “configuration.m” to add the necessary paths to MATLAB.
   Step 2: run "data_examples/example_1/marginal distribution.R" to characterize the distributional features of two variables.
   Step 3: run "copula_estimation/main_example_1.m" to estimate the copula model.
   Step 4: run "data_examples/example_1/main.m" to estimate global and local Kendall's tau between CSF FAM171A2 and total α-syn.
   Step 5: run "ld_surfaces/type_I_surface.m" and "ld_surfaces/type_II_surface.m" to draw two types of local dependence surfaces, respectively.
   Step 6: run "quantile_dependence/main_diagonal.m" and "quantile_dependence/minor_diagonal.m" to draw quantile Kendall's tau curves along the main and minor diagonals.
