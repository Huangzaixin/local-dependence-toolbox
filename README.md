# local dependence toolbox

This Matlab toolbox helps readers to reproduce all results in Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the paper "Generalized local Kendall’s τ: a framework for uncovering nonlinear local dependence".

## 1. Operation Steps: Illustrated with Example 1

   Step 1: run “configuration.m” to add the necessary paths to MATLAB.  
   Step 2: run "data examples/example_1/marginal distribution.R" to characterize the distributional features of two variables.  
   Step 3: run "copula estimation/main_example_1.m" to estimate the copula model.  
   Step 4: run "data examples/example_1/main.m" to estimate global and local Kendall's tau between CSF FAM171A2 and total α-syn.  
   Step 5: run "local dependence surfaces/type_I_surface.m" and "local dependence surfaces/type_II_surface.m" to draw two types of local dependence surfaces, respectively.  
   Step 6: run "quantile dependence/main_diagonal.m" and "quantile dependence/minor_diagonal.m" to draw quantile Kendall's tau curves along the main and minor diagonals.
